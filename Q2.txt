Original:
function printSmallGuildNames(memberCount)
-- this method is supposed to print names of all guilds that have less than memberCount max members
local selectGuildQuery = "SELECT name FROM guilds WHERE max_members < %d;"
local resultId = db.storeQuery(string.format(selectGuildQuery, memberCount))
local guildName = result.getString("name")
print(guildName)
end

Improved:
function printSmallGuildNames(memberCount)
	-- this method is supposed to print names of all guilds that have less than memberCount max members
	local selectGuildQuery = "SELECT name FROM guilds WHERE max_members < %d;"
	local resultId = db.storeQuery(string.format(selectGuildQuery, memberCount))
	if resultId ~= false than
		local guildName = result.getString(resultId, "name")
		result.free(resultId)
		print(guildName)
	end
end

Rationale:
Added missing "resultId" to result.getString() call
Called result.free(resultId) after getting the "name" value to free the query result so it can be used again
Checked that the query was successful in an if statement before trying to use the result
