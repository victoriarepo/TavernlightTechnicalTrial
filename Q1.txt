Original:
local function releaseStorage(player)
player:setStorageValue(1000, -1)
end

function onLogout(player)
if player:getStorageValue(1000) == 1 then
addEvent(releaseStorage, 1000, player)
end
return true
end

Improved:
function onLogout(player)
	if player:getStorageValue(1000) == 1 then
		player:setStorageValue(1000, -1)
	end
	return true
end

Rationale:
Reducing the number of function calls to increase efficiency
Events have overhead computation which can be avoided by calling player:setStorageValue() directly
Also added indentation for readability
Hard to know how to improve this code as it is a bit vague
