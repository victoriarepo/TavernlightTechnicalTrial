# Notes on Q5
- Wasn't sure which files were required but I only modified the Eternal Winter script and spells.xml (changed are combined in eternal_winter.lua)
- I included some notes on the installation process as this took the majority of my time (4 days)
- I found it incredibly difficult to do anything in these codebases as there doesn't seem to be any documentation at all
