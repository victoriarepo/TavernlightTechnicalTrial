First was getting the following errors:
'_' uses undefined struct 'fmt::v10::detail::type_is_unformattable_for<T,char>'
Severity Code Description Project File Line Suppression State Details Error C2338 static_assert failed: 'Cannot format an argument. To make type T formattable provide a formatter<T> specialization: https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#udt' theforgottenserver C:\Users\victo\Downloads\Tavernlight\vcpkg-master\installed\x64-windows\include\fmt\core.h 1604
Added the code below to tools.h to fix this by following: https://otland.net/threads/solved-core-h-errors-tfs-1-5-downgrade-8-6.287017/
template < typename E >
auto format_as(E e) {
	return fmt::underlying(e);
}

Then when running in visual studio it was saying it could not find lua.config
Followed this https://otland.net/threads/cannot-open-config-lua-no-such-file-or-directory.242102/
Copied contents of forgottenserver-1.4\vc17\x64\Release to location of lua.config.dist to fix

Downloaded and compiled OTClient but had an openssl error saying it could not find rsa.h
I spent me 3 days trying to install it manually but nothing working
I only got otclient building when I used vcpkg to install openssl 

Then I was getting an error that visual studio couldn't find pwsh.exe
Had to then install powershell 7 manually 
From what I read online it seems vcpkg doesn't always install this properly

Finally I could move on to the step "Running Your First OT Server"

Ran the OTClient and tried to log in but got errors about missing .spr and .dat files
Had to google to find out these need to be downloaded and to find where to download them from:
https://otland.net/threads/where-can-i-find-the-spr-dat-files-for-13-10.287783/
https://downloads.ots.me/?dir=data/tibia-clients/dat_and_spr
Found them and downloaded version 1074 because this version was already selected in the client
Then got an error saying it can only use 1098 so went and downloaded these instead
Next error was that my character couldn't be loaded and the forgotten server terminal said the town id 9 didn't exist
Found on google that this needs to be set to 1 so modified this in the database: https://otland.net/threads/town-id-help.226503/
Then log in was successful and the editor opened up

Was having trouble getting the area effect displaying in the shape I wanted using the OTClient linked in the email
A lot of people online recommended against using the OTClient by edubart: https://otland.net/threads/issue-on-the-animation-of-eternal-winter.281595/
I downloaded OTClientV8 instead and this seemed to fix the shape
