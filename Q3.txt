Original:
function do_sth_with_PlayerParty(playerId, membername)
player = Player(playerId)
local party = player:getParty()

for k,v in pairs(party:getMembers()) do
if v == Player(membername) then
party:removeMember(Player(membername))
end
end
end

Improved:
function RemovePlayerFromParty(playerId, membername)
	player = Player(playerId)
	local party = player:getParty()

	for k,partyMember in pairs(party:getMembers()) do
		if partyMember.name == membername
			party:removeMember(Player(membername))
		end
	end
end

Rationale:
Changed variable name of "v" to partyMember to improve readability
Changed the if statement to "if partyMember.name == membername" as it saves having to instantiate a new player object which is inefficient. We only need to check if the player has the specified name and don't need to check the whole player object
Changed function name to RemovePlayerFromParty to more accurately describe what it does and improve readability
